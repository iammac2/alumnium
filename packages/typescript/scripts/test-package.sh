# This script tests built npm packages by emulating real consumer usage.
#
# The fixtures (tests/npm/{esm,cjs}) are run from a temporary directory OUTSIDE
# the repository on purpose. Node resolves bare imports by walking up the
# directory tree through every parent node_modules, so running inside the
# monorepo lets the published package resolve packages that are only the repo's
# devDependencies, masking missing runtime dependencies that break real installs.
# See https://github.com/alumnium-hq/alumnium/issues/380
#
# The built packages are installed from their tarballs (not the dist dirs). pnpm
# extracts a tarball into its store — a real copy — so the package resolves its
# dependencies from the isolated temp dir. Installing a dist *directory* instead
# would symlink it back into the repo, defeating the isolation above.
